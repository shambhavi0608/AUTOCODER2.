                <h1>A New Home, A Strange Presence</h1>
                <p>Two weeks after moving into my new apartment, I noticed something unsettling—a locked room that was always wet. Every morning, I’d find puddles, and by the window, a silent white pigeon watched me.</p>

                <h1>The Calls Begin</h1>
                <p>At 3:21 AM, I started receiving 21 missed calls from an unknown number. One night, I answered. Static. Then—“Help me.” The call cut off. The locked room’s door creaked open, revealing walls dripping with water. In the reflection, I saw her—a woman who wasn’t there.</p>

                <p>I discovered a woman named Aanya had drowned in that room two years ago. Her body was never found. Only her phone, still ringing, with 21 unanswered calls to her brother.</p>
